This PRE DE PROVENCE SHEA BUTTER ENRICHED ARTISANAL FRENCH SOAP BAR (Olive Oil (250 g)) lathers beautifully, and feels luxurious.  It doesn't dry out or irritate my sensitive skin, so I can use it every day.  This is a large 250 gram olive oil bar that gives good value for the money (about $7 on Amazon).Lavender is my favorite soap fragrance, so it's no surprise that I love this PRE DE PROVENCE FRENCH LAVENDER BATH & SHOWER GEL.  For the shower, a pump or two is enough for a nice lather, and the lather washes off easily.

The lavender fragrance is delicate, and it lingers for only a short time.  It doesn't overwhelm perfume, aftershave lotion, shampoo, or other scented products you may like to use.  The clear gel arrives in an attractive square pump dispenser.

The shower gel leaves my skin silky smooth, and it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.I love Pre de Provence soaps, but was intensely curious about the Sea Salt bar.  What would it smell like?  Why would I want to wash my hands with sea salt?  Happily, this PRE DE PROVENCE SEA SALT FRENCH SOAP BAR (150g, 5.2 Ounce) is no different from the other Pre de Provence soaps--it smells wonderful, and produces a rich, thick lather.

The fragrance is hard to describe.  Its kind of floral, but maybe is best described as fresh sea breeze.  It makes one think of fresh air and sunshine.  The fragrance doesn't linger overlong.  The soap doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, but may be a little more drying than other Pre de Provence soaps (unless it's my imagination working overtime).

The soap definitely contains salt. The ingredients are:  sodium palmate, sodium palm kernelate, water, fragrance, palm acid, titanium dioxide, glycerin, palm kernel acid, SODIUM CHLORIDE, shea butter, sodium hydroxide, tetrasodium edta, tetrasodium etidronate, benzyl salicylate, linalool, geraniol, citral.This PRE DE PROVENCE Sandalwood SHEA BUTTER ENRICHED SOAP (250 Gram) should appeal to the male members of the household, because of the mild, woody fragrance.  (Most Pre de Provence soaps have fairly strong, flowery fragrances.)

It's a large bar of luxurious French soap.  It lathers beautifully, and the fragrance never lingers too long.  The soap is very gentle, and doesn't irritate sensitive skin.This PRE DE PROVENCE PATCHOULI SHEA BUTTER ENRICHED SOAP (250 Gram) has the mild, musky fragrance that many women find sexy, but the fragrance is risky.  To some people (including me) it smells like fungus or damp basement.  Still, this soap may appeal to male household members, because it's so different from most other Pre de Provence soaps (with their fairly strong, flowery fragrances).

This is a large bar of luxurious French soap.  It lathers beautifully, and the fragrance never lingers too long.  The soap is very gentle, and doesn't irritate sensitive skin.

For men, a much safer Pre de Provence soap is the Sandalwood bar (see&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pre-de-Provence-Sandalwood/dp/B01LWWOLW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pre de Provence Sandalwood</a>).My kids love using the Colgate pumps. I think it just seems fun to them and they are easier for kids to operate than having to squeeze tubes. I do feel like the pumps leave a little bit left in the bottom though so you get a little bit less product with them. The pumps are definitely less messy though.

Our order came as 6 pumps of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection in mild bubble fruit flavor. The toothpaste is a blue gel. Its slightly fruity but still minty. All 6 pumps had an expiration date of 10/2017 (this is 8/2016) so the expiration date is over a year out - plenty of time to use all 6 pumps. All the pumps have a safety seal on the pump that has to be broken off so you know they are sealed and safe.

The kids really like this flavor and the pump.Review for Starflower:

This is a nice bar of soap. It has a hard consistency, not a soft bar so it seems to last longer. The soap provides a lot of suds which makes you feel like you are getting clean. It is a large size too which my husband really loves.

I had never smelled starflower before. The scent of the soap is a floral but not in a heavy or sweet type scent, it smells nothing like roses or magnolias but is just clean floral scent. Im not a big fan of florals and this one is ok, my husband doesnt care for anything girly scented and he doesnt mind this one either.Review for Loofah:

I have tried loofahs in the past and was never a big fan but I gave the Urban Spa Loofah a try and Im glad that I did. The loofah arrives a little flat from packaging but swells up nice and round in the water. It is surprisingly soft in the water. It works great with body wash providing lots of suds.

I like that it has an attached ribbon and suction cup. I thought that the suction cup being attached would bother me as I used it but it has not. Its nice that I can hang it on my shower door. It attaches securely and I haven't had any trouble with it slipping or sliding on the glass.Have used for a long time and nothing has worked better. This is a winner and I will continue to purchase it.This is my favorite floss.  I do feel like my teeth are much cleaner when I use it.  Like the name says, it glides easily between my teeth, no sticking or shredding.  The plastic container is small, compact and attractive.  The minty flavor is a nice touch.This PRE DE PROVENCE SHEA BUTTER ENRICHED ARTISANAL FRENCH SOAP BAR (Olive Oil (250 g)) lathers beautifully, and feels luxurious.

It attaches securely and I haven't had any trouble with it slipping or sliding on the glass.Have used for a long time and nothing has worked better. This is a winner and I will continue to purchase it.This is my favorite floss.  I do feel like my teeth are much cleaner when I use it.  Like the name says, it glides easily between my teeth, no sticking or shredding.  The plastic container is small, compact and attractive.  The minty flavor is a nice touch.
